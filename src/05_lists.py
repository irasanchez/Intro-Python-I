# For the exercise, look up the methods and functions that are available for use
# with Python lists.

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [8, 9, 10]

# For the following, DO NOT USE AN ASSIGNMENT (=).

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4]
x.append(4)
print("1. ", x)

# Using y, change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10]
#learning notes:
#   using append will add the whole array into one index
x.extend(y)
print("2. ", x)

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10]
x.remove(8)
print("3. ", x)

# Change x so that it is [1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 99, 10]
# index 5, value 99
x.insert(5, 99)
print("4. ", x)

# Print the length of list x
print("5. ", len(x))

# Print all the values in x multiplied by 1000
print("5. üëáüèΩ")
for element in x:
    print(element*1000)
